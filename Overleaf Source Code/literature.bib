abstract = {Abstract Knowledge modeling is an important step in building knowledge-based applications. Understanding the processes of knowledge modeling and the techniques involved can help developers to grasp the knowledge modeling task as a whole and improve the efficiency of execution and management of modeling tasks. However, previous reviews on knowledge modeling mainly focus on ontology-based knowledge modeling. At present, there is no research work to summarize nonontology knowledge modeling methods, nor to systematically summarize the processes and techniques of knowledge modeling. In this paper, the processes, techniques, and characteristics of knowledge modeling methods based on ontology and nonontology are surveyed. Three research questions related to knowledge modeling are proposed. (1) What methods can be used for knowledge modeling? (2) What processes are involved in knowledge modeling? (3) What techniques are used in the processes of knowledge modeling? By answering these questions, the results of the survey help developers choose appropriate knowledge modeling methods in their work and complete modeling tasks effectively. Meanwhile, it is also conducive to the research work of improving knowledge modeling methods in the future.},

abstract={Manufacturers migrate their processes to Industry 4.0, which includes new technologies for improving productivity and efficiency of operations. One of the issues is capturing, recreating, and documenting the tacit knowledge of the aging workers. However, there are no systematic procedures to incorporate this knowledge into Enterprise Resource Planning systems and maintain a competitive advantage. This paper describes a solution proposal for a tacit knowledge elicitation process for capturing operational best practices of experienced workers in industrial domains based on a mix of algorithmic techniques and a cooperative game. We use domain ontologies for Industry 4.0 and reasoning techniques to discover and integrate new facts from textual sources into an Operational Knowledge Graph. We describe a concepts formation iterative process in a role game played by human and virtual agents through socialization and externalization for knowledge graph refinement. Ethical and societal concerns are discussed as well.},

abstract = {Abstract After the Seveso disaster occurred more than 40 years ago, there has been an increasing awareness of the potential impacts that similar accident events can occur in a wide range of process establishments, where the handling and production of hazardous substances pose a real threat to society and the environment. In these industrial sites denominated “Seveso sites,” the urgent need for an effective strategy emerged markedly to handle hazardous activities and to ensure safe conditions. Since then, the main challenging research issues have focused on how to prevent such accident events and how to mitigate their consequences leading to the development of many risk assessment methodologies. In recent years, researchers and practitioners have tried to provide useful overviews of the existing risk assessment methodologies proposing several reviews. However, these reviews are not exhaustive because they are either dated or focus only on one specific topic (e.g., liquefied natural gas, domino effect, etc.). This work aims to overcome the limitations of the current reviews by providing an up-to-date and comprehensive overview of the risk assessment methodologies for handling hazardous substances within the European industry. In particular, we have focused on the current techniques for hazards and accident scenarios identification, as well as probability and consequence analyses for both onshore and offshore installations. Thus, we have identified the research streams that have characterized the activities of researchers and practitioners over the years, and we have then presented and discussed the different risk assessment methodologies available concerning the research stream that they belong to.}

abstract={In the process design and reuse of marine component products, there are a lot of heterogeneous models, causing the problem that the process knowledge and process design experience contained in them are difficult to express and reuse. Therefore, a process knowledge representation model for ship heterogeneous model is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the multi-element process knowledge graph is constructed, and the heterogeneous ship model is described in a unified way. Then, the multi-strategy ontology mapping method is applied, and the semantic expression between the process knowledge graph and the entity model is realized. Finally, by obtaining implicit semantics based on case-based reasoning and checking the similarity of the matching results, the case knowledge reuse is achieved, to achieve rapid design of the process. This method provides reliable technical support for the design of ship component assembly and welding process, greatly shortens the design cycle, and improves the working efficiency. In addition, taking the double-deck bottom segment of a ship as an example, the process knowledge map of the heterogeneous model is constructed to realize the rapid design of ship process, which shows that the method can effectively acquire the process knowledge in the design case and improve the efficiency and intelligence of knowledge reuse in the process design of the heterogeneous model of a ship.},
